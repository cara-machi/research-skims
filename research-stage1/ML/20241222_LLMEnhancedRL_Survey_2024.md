## 1) Problem (informal, 1 sentence) 
-  How to combine large language model with reinforcement learning so agent can reason, plan, and learn more efficiently.
## 2) Why this problem exists (context)
- Pure RL struggle with long-horizon planning and sparse rewards. 
- LLMs have strong reaosning ability but lack grounding in physical interaction
- Researchers want systems that can both **think in language** and **act in environments**. 
## 3) Vocabulary & terms (list up to 6–8)
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Neural networks trained on massive text data that can understand and generate human language 
- Reinforcement Learning (RL): A learning framework where an agent improve its behaviror by trail and error using rewards. 
- LLM‑enhanced RL: Methods that use language models to guide, structure, or improve reinforcement learning agents. 
- Representation learning: Learning compact features from raw data that make tasks like prediction or control easier
- Sample efficiency:How much useful learning a method gets from a limited amount of data or experience
- Multi‑task learning: Traning a simple model to perform multiple tasks so knowledge can be shared across them 
- High‑level reasoning: The ability to plan, decompose goals, or make abstract decisions beyond low-level actions. 
- Benchmark / evaluation: Standard tasks and metrics used. to compare different methods fairly
- Taxonomy: A structured way to organize and compare a research field. 

## 4) Solution pattern (choose 1–2)
- Benchmark /taxonomy
## 5) What this paper is *not* doing
- Introduce new algorithm 
- Provide implmentation details

## 6) Why another paper / lab would *cite* this
- To summarize the field of LLM + RL methods. 

## 7) One question I now have (no answer)
- Do LLM-guided agents actully work better in real robotic systems, or mainly in simulated tasks?
