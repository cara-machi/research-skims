## 1) Problem (informal, 1 sentence)
- Robotics systems increasingly rely on deep learning, but the landscape is broad and difficult for new researchers (especially interns) to navigate. 

## 2) Why this problem exists (context)
- Robotics applications span perception, control, and decision making — all domains where deep learning is being integrated. 
- There was no concise overview focused on deep learning methods specifically useful for robotics interns at CMU.

## 3) Vocabulary & terms (list up to 6)
- Deep learning  
- Robotics perception  
- Control systems  
- Learning for robotics  
- Representation learning  
- Survey / synthesis

## 4) Solution pattern (choose 1–2)
- Survey / Aggregation  
- Conceptual mapping

## 5) What this paper is *not* doing
- Does not introduce a novel algorithm  
- Does not provide experimental results on hardware

## 6) Why another paper / lab would *cite* this
- Provides a **comprehensive overview** of deep learning in robotics relevant to CMU research.  
- Useful as a reference for interns and newcomers to see connections across robotics deep learning methods. 

## 7) One question I now have (no answer)
- Which methods highlighted here have **open‑source implementations** used in CMU labs?
