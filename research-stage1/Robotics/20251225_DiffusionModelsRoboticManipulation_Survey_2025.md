## 1) Problem (informal, 1 sentence)
- Having hard time modeling complex and multi-domain distribution 

## 2) Why this problem exists (context)
- Robotic manipulation is high-dimensional and uncertain.
- Multiple sensory inputs and objects dynamics complicate leraning. 
- Existing models often struggle to generalize across tasks or environments. 

## 3) Vocabulary & terms (list up to 6–8)
- **Diffusion models:** Generative probabilistic methods that transform noise into structured outputs via iterative denoising. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 4) Solution pattern (choose 1–2)
- Benchmark

## 5) What this paper is *not* doing
- Does not introduce a algorithmn.

## 6) Why another paper would *cite* this
- Introduces a benchmark for state-of-the-art methodologies used in Robotics
- To get a concise summary of methods and trends in this area. 

## 7) One question I now have (no answer)   
- How can diffusion models be made more sample-efficient and robust for real-world robtoics beyond current benchmark
