## 1) Problem (informal, 1 sentence)
- 3D environment representations has been a challenge in robotics domain, and NeRFs brings good news to this area. 

## 2) Why this problem exists (context)
- Early works focus on statcis scene reconstrction and face challenging in scalability and geometric accuracy.

## 3) Vocabulary & terms (list up to 6–8)
- **NeRF:** Neural Radiance Fields, 3D scene representation  
- **Implicit representation:** Encoding objects/scenes via neural networks  
- **Rendering:** Synthesizing images from 3D representations  
- **Perception pipeline:** Steps for a robot to understand environment  
- **Scene reconstruction:** Rebuilding environment geometry for interaction  
- **Manipulation / interaction:** Robot acting on or with objects  
- **Simulation / environment:** Virtual setup for testing  
- **Benchmarking:** Standardized tests for evaluation  

## 4) Solution pattern (choose 1–2)
- Deep learning / Benchmarking

## 5) What this paper is *not* doing
- Not introducing a new algorithm 
- Focus is on surveying existing FeRF applicattion in robotics. 

## 6) Why another paper / lab would *cite* this
- To reference the state-of-the-art application of NeRFs in robotics and to guide design of perception pipelines or benchmarks. 

## 7) One question I now have (no answer)
- What realisitc challenges could NeRFs face in robotic development, and how can these be addressed?
