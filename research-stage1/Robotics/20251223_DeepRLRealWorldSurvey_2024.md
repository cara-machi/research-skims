## 1) Problem (informal, 1 sentence)
- How DRL is being applied to real-world robotics and what success and challenges exist. 

## 2) Why this problem exists (context)
- Simulation-based RL does not fuly capture real-world complexity. 
- Physical robots have safety, cost, and sample-efficiency constraint. 
- Researchers need a comprehensive overview to guide experiments and identify gaps. 

## 3) Vocabulary & terms (list up to 6–8)
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL):** RL with deep neural networks :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Real‑world robotics:** applying RL beyond simulation to physical robots  
- **Sample efficiency:** how effectively RL learns from interaction data  
- **Policy optimization:** methods to update policies toward higher reward  
- **Robotic competencies:** manipulation, locomotion, navigation etc.  
- **Open‑world tasks:** environments not easily formalized or bounded  
- **Holistic integration:** combining perception + control + planning  
- **Evaluation procedures:** standardized ways to measure RL performance

## 4) Solution pattern (choose 1–2)
- Benchmark

## 5) What this paper is *not* doing
- Not proposing a new algorithm
- Not providing implemenntation code
- Note testing new robotics hardward

## 6) Why another paper / lab would *cite* this
- Reference for state-of-the-art DRL application in real robots
- Framework for comparing methods across tasks and platforms

## 7) One question I now have (no answer)
- Should the focus for improving real-word performance be on DRL algorithms, hardward design, or combined systems?
